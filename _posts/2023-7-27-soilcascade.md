One of the most important features of the theory of turbulence, due to among others Richardson and Kolmogorov, is that energy dissipates in eddies, from the largest eddies to the small ones forming an energy cascade. Another fundamental characteristic of the theory of turbulence is that it is a stochastic theory and deals with scaling, and as far as I am concern, self-similarity. Energy dissipation is largest in eddies of large diameters and small at the viscous range, where the diameters of the eddies is small compared to some characteristic length. Because of the chaotic nature, most current theories deal with averages of the fluid properties to describe the phenomena. 

Scaling and self-similarity have been used for several decades to characterize soils. In soils the smallest “fundamental” particles will aggregate in ever increasing domains forming the levels of soil aggregation, from individual particles, to micro-, meso- and macroaggregates to soil horizons and profiles. The assembly of aggregate structures from natural processes might be thought as energy storage in different domains. Aggregation is thought to be a result of physicochemical processes and the action of organism along with natural processes such as temperature and water content variations. The dis-assemblage of soil will require input of energy and there will be a distribution of energy corresponding to the sizes of the aggregates or the structural domain, each structural domain storing a fraction of the total energy. It is difficult to predict if more energy is stored in large aggregates, because often these are the easiest to crumble. It is possible that where the largest fraction of the energy is stored in relation to size will give important information about soil formation and structural stability, but it is unclear if any correlation with an energy cascade, as with turbulence, can be derived for soil structure under natural conditions.
