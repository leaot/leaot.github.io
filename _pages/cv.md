Here is my extended (but far from complete) <a href="https://leaot.github.io/assets/pdf/tpl-cv-us.pdf"> CV <a>

Here is my extended (somewhat complete) CV at the Brazilian Lattes <a href="[https://leaot.github.io/assets/pdf/tpl-cv-us.pdf](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7920357457851780)"> system <a> (Note: it is sort of mandatory and I don't really support this sort of thing)

Please note that I am a coauthor in fields as diverse as biology, food science, meteorology ... because I have contributed in data analysis, statistical methods and programming in these publications
