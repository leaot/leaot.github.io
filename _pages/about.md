I have degrees in Physics, Earth and Planetary Sciences and Agronomy.

I am interested in physics and fluid mechanics applied to porous media. 

Currently working at an Agronomy school, but I am interested in moving to a Physics or Earth and Planetary Sciences department. 

I have interest in teaching introductory physics courses, transport in porous media, groundwater hydrology and introductory computational physics.
